# Human Posture Recognition using Hybrid CNN-SVM-RF

This project implements a hybrid deep learning + machine learning framework for human posture recognition.

## Features
- CNN model for feature extraction
- Hybrid SVM + Random Forest ensemble classifier
- Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` → Colab notebook used during development
- `src/` → Python scripts (modular code)
- `train.py` → End-to-end training & evaluation pipeline

## Results
- Baseline CNN Accuracy: ~90.8%
- Hybrid CNN-SVM-RF Accuracy: ~91.5%
